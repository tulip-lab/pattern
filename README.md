## Content

This *course* (aka *unit*) delves into the foundational aspects of automated pattern recognition and its associated subjects, including object characterization. The primary focus is on the fundamental theories and frameworks of statistical pattern recognition, with practical applications in computer vision, social science data analysis, and other relevant domains.

The initial portion of the course concentrates on generative methods rooted in Bayes decision theory, encompassing techniques for parameter estimation and density estimation. Following that, the course shifts attention towards discriminative methods such as support vector machines, as well as non-parametric techniques, notably nearest-neighbor classification.

Pattern classification plays a pivotal role in various applications, such as information retrieval, data mining, multimedia analysis and recognition, computational linguistics, information forensics, biometrics, and bioinformatics. Additionally, this subject introduces additional topics derived from real-world research projects, providing students with practical insights and exposure to contemporary advancements in the field.



## Sessions

Students will have access to a comprehensive range of subject materials, comprising slides handouts, practicals, assessment documents, and relevant readings. It is recommended that students commence their engagement with each session by thoroughly reviewing the pertinent slides handouts and readings to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the content. 

Additionally, students are encouraged to supplement their knowledge by conducting independent research, utilizing online resources or referring to textbooks that cover relevant information related to the topics under study.

### Practicals

You are recommended to use Cloud platform to run the materials, such as:

- [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com): which will be used in the practical classes.

### :u6e80: Assessment

The assessment of the unit is mainly aimed at assessing the students' achievement of the unt learning outcomes (ULOs, a.k.a. objectives), and checking the students' mastery of those algorithms/models and theory covered in the unit. 

#### :book: Assessment Plan


[ULO1](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO1)
[ULO2](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO2)
[ULO3](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO3)

The relationship between each assessment task and the ULOs are shown as follows:

| :microscope: <br> Task  |   :man_teacher: <br> Category |  :dart: <br> [ULO1](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO1)  | :dart: <br> [ULO2](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO2) |  :dart: <br> [ULO3](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO3)  |  Percentage | 
| :----: |  :---: | ------|-------| ----- |  ----- |  
| :one: | Presentation | 50%| 25%  |   25%  | **25%** |  
| :two: | Project |  | 30%  |   70%  |  **50%** |
| :two: | Report <br> Presentation | 20%| 40%  |  40%  |  **25%** |

[S00D-Assessment](S00-Induction/S00D-Assessment.md) 


#### :spiral_calendar: Submission Due Dates

The final assessment files submissions due date is `Saturday, 11/11/2023`

It is expected that you will submit each assessment component on time. You will not be allowed to start everything at the last moment, because we will provide you with feedback that you will be expected to use in future assessments.

If you find that you are having trouble meeting your deadlines, contact the [Unit Chair](S00B-Team.md).
