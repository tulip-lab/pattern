# Machine Learning Theory

`Probably Approximately Correct` (PAC) learning theory is a framework in machine learning that provides theoretical guarantees for learning algorithms. It focuses on the generalization of learned models from a limited sample of data to unseen instances.

In PAC learning theory, a learning algorithm is considered successful if it can produce a hypothesis that is "probably approximately correct." This means that the hypothesis has a low generalization error and is likely to perform well on future unseen data.


`Model Evaluation`, on the other hand, is the process of assessing the performance or quality of a trained model. It involves measuring how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data and evaluating its predictive accuracy.

Common techniques for model evaluation include:

1. Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into a training set and a separate test set. The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the test set to estimate its performance.

2. Cross-Validation: It involves splitting the data into multiple subsets, or folds, and iteratively training and testing the model on different combinations of these folds. Cross-validation helps obtain a more reliable estimate of model performance.

3. Evaluation Metrics: Various metrics are used to assess model performance, depending on the specific task. Examples include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for classification problems, and mean squared error for regression problems.

Model evaluation is crucial for understanding how well a trained model is likely to perform on unseen data and for comparing different models or algorithms. It helps in selecting the best model for a given task and identifying areas for improvement or further optimization.
