# :clap: Welcome to `Pattern Classification`

Welcome to 'Pattern Classification', the unit on 'Pattern Recognition'. In this unit you will have the opportunity to learn basic aspects of automated pattern recognition and related topics such as machine learning techniques and various applications of pattern recognition.

As a unit for elite students, this unit is designed with flexibility, and there is a great deal of responsibility placed on you to manage your own learning. This unit assumes some prior knowledge in any programming language, but your problem-solving abilities that are much needed. That is, your skills of getting insight into any particular data at hand, are extremely valuable. All the practical materials will be based on [Python programming](https://www.python.org/). In case that you have no prior `Python` experience, I strongly suggest you to start with the preliminary module in our sister unit `SIT742` - :book: [Python Foundations](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742).

In this unit, we will introduce you to a series of pattern classification techniques. They can be considered *advanced*, or *intermediate* or for some of you, may be *basic*. The motivation for discussing these techniques with you is that it will:

- give you an understanding of the inner-working of these techniques;
- help you to structure your thought-process when you design algorithms, so that you can communicate complicated ideas effectively;
- and give you some experience in devising and planning your own pattern recognition or more general AI applications for any particular scenario.

We will discuss the details of the modalities of this unit very soon, but keep in mind that the unit is designed around [`Sessions`](../README.md#Sessions). We would like you to go through the sessions following the [`Recommended Session Schedule`](../README.md#session-plan) at the time of your ease.

I hope you have an enjoyable and challenging unit, and get as much out of it as possible. The [unit team](S00B-Team.md) will help you to achieve it â€“ and I believe that we will all enjoy the journey. More broadly, I would like you to start with a YouTube video:
