# :clap: Welcome to `Pattern Classification`

Welcome to 'Pattern Classification', the unit on 'Pattern Recognition'. In this unit you will have the opportunity to learn basic aspects of automated pattern recognition and related topics such as machine learning techniques and various applications of pattern recognition. As an advanced unit for motivated students, it is designed to be flexible, with great responsibility placed on you to direct your own learning. The unit assumes prior experience with programming, but ultimately values creative problem-solving abilities and deriving insights from data above all. All practical materials will utilize `Python`. If you are new to Python, I strongly encourage reviewing the preliminary `Python` module in  `SIT742` - :book: [Python Foundations](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742).


In this unit, we will introduce you to a series of pattern classification techniques, ranging from *basic* to *advanced*. The motivation for discussing these techniques is threefold: 
- To build an understanding of the inner workings of each method
- To structure your thought process when designing algorithms and communicating complex ideas
- To provide hands-on experience in devising and planning pattern recognition and AI applications

We will discuss the details of the modalities of this unit very soon, but keep in mind that the unit is designed around [`Sessions`](../README.md#Sessions). We would like you to go through the sessions following the [`Recommended Session Schedule`](../README.md#session-plan) at the time of your ease.

I hope you find this unit enjoyable, challenging, and rewarding. The [unit team](S00B-Team.md) is here to help you succeed, and we look forward to the journey together. As an introduction, I encourage you to watch this video on the era of big data and expanding opportunities in AI:

With curiosity and dedication, I am confident you will gain valuable skills and knowledge in `pattern classification` techniques that will serve you well into the future. Welcome aboard!
