# :sunny: Unit Assessment

The modular structure ties in closely to the unit assessment:

- In order to achieve a `Pass` in this unit, all [core sessions](M00C-Logistics.md#core-sessions) must be satisfactorily completed.
- If you would like to achieve a higher grade than a `Pass`, (e.g. a `Credit`, `Distinction` or `High Distinction`) you will need to complete some [advanced sessions](M00C-Logistics.md#advanced-sessions), as well as some higher level study in the extra readings in the core and advanced modules.

### :spiral_calendar: Assessment Due Dates

It is expected that you will submit each assessment task on time. You will not be allowed to submit everything at the last moment, because we will provide you with feedback that you will be expected to use in future assessments.

If you find that you are having trouble meeting your deadlines, speak to the [Unit Chair](S00B-Team.md). 

### :u6e80: Grades

The final grade (or mark) you receive has a real meaning. A `Pass` reflects that *you have satisfactorily mastered all required learning*, while a higher grade indicates that *you've achieved above and beyond this basic understanding*. Typically, your final grade/mark reflects how much you have achieved in those sessions: 

- `Pass`: Complete all [core sessions](S00C-Logistics.md#core-sessions).
- `Credit`: Complete all [core sessions](S00C-sessions.md#core-sessions), plus one [advanced sessions](S00C-Logistics.md#advanced-sessions) or extra reading.
- `Distinction`: Complete all [core sessions](S00C-Logistics.md#core-sessions), plus the assessment task which is related to [advanced sessions](S00C-Logistics.md#advanced-sessions) or extra reading (this includes the ones you would complete for a `Credit`), with **satisfactory** performance.
- `High Distinction`: Complete all [core sessions](S00C-Logistics.md#core-sessions), plus the assessment task which is related to [advanced sessions](S00C-Logistics.md#advanced-sessions) or extra reading, with **outstanding** performance.  You may define and research an additional topic (that is, fulfil all the criteria for a `distinction`), and the teaching team will assist you in validating an appropriate topic for study.


You must also write a report and present (virtual presentations) on a more advanced topic (which can be the one you studied from the `Distinction`). The teaching team will provide guidance on how to do this. 

###  :scream_cat: Getting Help

As mentioned above, we can provide you with a greater level of support, particularly if you're feeling stuck. Our aim is for that support to be there at the time you need it. It's quite normal to meet some difficulties from time to time. If you already knew how to do everything, there wouldn't be much learning happening, would there? If you are having troubles going through some content, here are some of the things that you can do:

#### Have issues with assumed knowledge?

-  Ask it under the relevant topic in the discussion forums (check the previous discussions first: your question might already have been answered)
- If you need class time and tutor support, you are welcome to attend any session. 
    - You are encouraged to discuss this with the unit chair, who will give you suitable recommendations.


#### Have a question?

- Discussion forums – within the `Discussions` area of [`CloudDeakin`](https://d2l.deakin.edu.au) `SIT742` unit site, you will see a forum for you to post questions for each module, preliminary, core and advanced. You don't have to wait to be in class, or for the next help hub session to ask your question, and you are likely to get a prompt answer by other students or the teaching staff. You might find that your questions have already been asked and answered, and if not, your question is likely to help others who struggle with the same issues.

#### Need a study-mate, for group work, motivation or to bounce ideas?

- The assessment task might be a group work. In case that a group is needed, you can either post messages in the discussion, or form a group with peers when attending the class or practicals.
#### Have a more personal issue affecting your studies?

- [teaching team](S00B-Team.md#unit-team-contacts) – you can reach out to the teaching team directly by email, particularly in case of more personal problems.
- Email the unit chair.

> 1. Access this year's assessment tasks, and compare it with those demonstration tasks covered in practical classes. Make a study plan for your `SIT742` study, and think about forming a team for group assessment.
