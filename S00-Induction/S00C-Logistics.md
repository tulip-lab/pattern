# Unit Logistics

## :rocket: Teaching Method

`Pattern Clasification` has shifted the traditional delivery of lectures into a multi-faceted teaching methodology that includes classroom teaching, project development, in-depth discussions and seminars on various AI  projects. The unit content is structured around the following key aspects:

- **Building a strong foundation**: The unit focuses on providing fundamental knowledge of pattern recognition, including Bayesian decision theory, MLE/MAP estimation, non-parametric methods, dimensionality reduction and stochastic methods. By gaining a thorough understanding of these fundamental concepts and principles, students will be equipped to undertake real-world pattern recognition projects.

- **Developing engineering skills**: Students are encouraged, inspired and guided to choose their own topics or to participate in hands-on research conducted by unit team members. This approach enables students to apply their acquired knowledge and enhance their creative skills. The unit places a strong emphasis on practical skills and encourages student interaction, collaboration, independent thinking and problem solving.

- **Instilling values and cultivating a scientific mindset**: The unit aims to instil in students the spirit of a scientist. Theoretical courses embed this scientific spirit, while practical courses emphasise its application. By fostering qualities such as the pursuit of truth, kindness, humility, critical thinking, innovation and cooperation, the unit contributes to the development of students' scientific character. It encourages questioning, analytical thinking, hypothesising, testing, experimenting and perseverance.

- **Exploring scientific frontiers**: The unit emphasises the integration of knowledge with the latest advances in the field. At the end of each knowledge module, the latest research in the field is presented, accompanied by a comprehensive bibliography. This provides students with the necessary skills to explore and delve into further study independently. The course also links theoretical knowledge to practical problems and national development strategies, thus fostering a sense of national responsibility among students.

### Unit Materials

In this unit, all lecture slides handouts will be provided prior to the class, so that students can prepare in advance and have some question prepared for the lecture sessions. Moreover, the practicals are all available publicly, and students are expected to work on those practicals themselves (especially for deliveries which have no practical allocation).

Just because we give you a lot of the content in advance, it doesn't mean that we expect you to teach yourself. You do the **learning** – we can't do that part instead of you – but you can still leave the **teaching** to us: you will have ample opportunities to ask questions in the class: **interactive activities** will be done in the weekly lectures and/or practical classes (if with time allocation). For those who can't make it to the live sessions or have urgent questions that can't wait for the next available class, through the discussion forums at GitHub 
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/tulip-lab/pattern)](https://github.com/tulip-lab/pattern/issues).

#### :microscope: Sessions

To facilitate the study, we have organised the contents into a structure where each session corresponding to one set of classes. In each session, you are provided with the lecture slides handouts, notes as well as practical activities.

Within this unit, you'll find [preliminary sessions](#preliminary-sessions), [core sessions](#core-sessions) and [advanced sessions](#advanced-sessions). We'll explain each of these, and how they relate to your unit assessment.

We would like you to go through the sessions at the time of your ease, and then work on the `assessment` tasks. The first thing you'll notice when you begin working through the sessions is that each has a consistent format, especially featuring:

- A `session` `README.md` page: here you'll find the overview for the session, and most download materials are available through this page. It is especially important that you make note of these as they explain the sessions structure and the supplementary resources for the session. In order to successfully complete each session, you will need to demonstrate that you have achieved each of these objectives.

### Preliminary Sessions

We assume no prior `Python` experience, and any prior knowledge on programming will be a bonus: if you already have completed several units such as `machine learing`, `deep learning`, you should be reasonably confident about your `Python` programming skills.

In case that you have no `Python` experience, `SIT742` - :book: [Python Foundations](https://github.com/tulip-lab/sit742) will prepare you in this aspect and enable you to continue into the [core sessions](#core-sessions). 

### Core Sessions

At the heart of the unit are six core sessions. These core sessions address the statistical pattern recognition techniques that are relevant and important for AI researchers and data analysters. Therefore, it is an essential requirement of this unit that all core sessions are completed.

### Advanced Sessions

In additional to the [core sessions](#core-sessions), there are also a series of advanced topics. These topics are **optional** and they are either build on the information in the [core sessions](#core-sessions) by exploring concepts in greater depth, or introduce new, more specialised topics.

They are there for those wishing to expand their knowledge or explore specific topics in further detail. Depending on your course, you may like to choose those advanced topics which are most relevant.


## :dart: Unit Learning Outcomes 

- **ULO1** - Develop knowledge of pattern recognition in order to select or develop appropriate algorithms and models for given applications; (1, 2, 3)
- **ULO2** - Use different measures to evaluate the costs and risks associated with different decisions and to identify optimal solutions to specific pattern recognition problems; (4, 5)
- **ULO3** - Apply pattern recognition techniques in a real-world project, work collaboratively in a team to develop the solution and present the methodology and results for a given scenario; (5, 9, 10)

We aim to generate enthusiasm for pattern recognition and improve teaching effectiveness through lecturer experience sharing, session-based discussion and real-world project-based assessment.
