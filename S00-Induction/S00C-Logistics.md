### :medal_sports: Graduate Learning Outcomes

Different universities have different set of GLOs, for example:

<summary>GLO for [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn) </summary>

:one:  Engineering knowledge: a solid mathematics required in computer engineering, natural sciences, engineering base and expertise to solve complex engineering problems.


:two: Problem Analysis: able to apply the basic principles of mathematics, natural sciences and engineering sciences to identify, express, and through literature research and analysis of complex engineering computer engineering problem to reach a valid conclusion.

:three: Design / development solutions: can integrate the use of theory and techniques to design solutions to complex engineering problems in the field of computer engineering, designed to meet the information access, transmission systems, processing or use of other needs, the unit (member) or process processes, and to reflect the sense of innovation in the design session, taking into account the social, health, safety, legal, cultural and environmental factors.

## :rocket: A Pioneer `CloudFirst` Unit

SIT742 has shifted the traditional delivery of lectures and practicals into an online format of [`CloudFirst`](https://dteach.deakin.edu.au/2019/03/21/221812/), because we think that it is much better to use lecture time for interactive activities as well as the latest data science case studies.

Typical lectures are not interactive: most students spend most of the time listening, which they can do just as well with video lectures or video demonstrations (if you don't believe us, do the maths: even in a 25-people practical class of 50 minutes, each student will get an average of 2 minutes of lecturer's or tutor's attention). So, we’re moving that part of the teaching `CloudFirst`, and free up time for the [teaching team](M01B-Team.md) to work with you on **activities that are best done interactively**, and on **the latest data science case studies**.  

Just because we give you a lot of the content in advance, that doesn't mean that we expect you to teach yourself. You do the **learning** – we can't do that part instead of you – but you can still leave the **teaching** to us: you will have ample opportunities to ask questions to the tutors and lecturers: **interactive activities** will be done in the weekly lectures and practical classes. For those who can't make it to the live sessions or have urgent questions that can't wait for the next available live interaction, through the discussion forums or `MS Teams`.

## :microscope: `SIT742` Modules

To facilitate the `CloudFirst` study, we have organised SIT742 into a structure where each focused topic area is set up as a module. In each module, you are provided with the notes, some video explanations or demonstrations, as well as learning activities.

Within this unit, you'll find :one: [preliminary module](#preliminary-modules), :three: [core modules](#core-modules) and :one: [advanced modules](#advanced-modules). We'll explain each of these, and how they relate to your unit assessment.

We would like you to go through the modules at the time of your ease, and then work on the `assessment` tasks. The first thing you'll notice when you begin working through the modules is that each has a consistent format, featuring:

- A `module` `README.md` page: here you'll find the overview for the module. It is especially important that you make note of these as they explain the sessions structure and the supplementary resources for the module. In order to successfully complete each module, you will need to demonstrate that you have achieved each of these objectives.
- A series of `topic` pages: these provide the range of learning materials.
- A series of `learning activities`: these provide the range of learning activities that will enable you to achieve the learning objectives, and those activities are corresponding to the session topic. You are expected to complete those learning activities on your own, but if there is any difficulty, you can ask the tutors in the practical class. 
- A `practical class` page: which is similar to every year's assessment tasks. More than one task options are available for some modules, and [SIT742 Tutors](M01B-Team.md) will have their own choice of module task option in their practical class. You are highly recommended to work on those tasks prior to the practical class, and then the tutor will go through their own task option with you and show you how to complete those tasks.  

### Preliminary Module

SIT742 assumes no prior `Python` experience, and any prior knowledge on programming will be a bonus: if you already have completed several data science units such as `SIT720`, `SIT744`, you should be reasonably confident about your `Python` programming skills.

In case that you have no `Python` experience, SIT742 [preliminary module - Module 2](../M02-Python/README.md) will prepare you in this aspect and enable you to continue into the [core modules](#core-modules). 

### Core Modules

At the heart of the unit are three core modules. These core modules address the big data concepts and techniques that are relevant and important for data scientists and data analysts. Therefore, it is an essential requirement of this unit that all core modules are completed.

### Advanced Module

In additional to the [core modules](#core-modules), there are also a series of advanced topics. These topics are **optional** and organised into the [advanced module - Module 6](../M06-Advanced/README.md). Those topics either build on the information in the [core modules](#core-modules) by exploring concepts in greater depth, or introduce new, more specialised topics.

They are there for those wishing to expand their knowledge or explore specific topics in further detail. Depending on your course, you may like to choose those advanced topics which are most relevant.
